A '''foundation''' is a kind of [[company]] set up to carry out [[charity (practice)|charity]] or [[research]] work. A foundation is usually [[endowed]], which means it is given a large sum of [[money]] to do its work. An example is the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. The [[Rockefeller family]] made their money from [[banking]] and [[oil]] and their family foundation is endowed with a very great sum of money. The people running the foundation think of ways to use the money to help charities, the arts, or whatever they like.

Another example is the [[Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation]]. Bill Gates made a [[Wealth|fortune]] from [[Microsoft]]. He and his wife now spend nearly all their time giving away the money he has made. They give it to [[project]]s like [[education]] in the [[United States]] and treating [[AIDS]] in [[Third World]] countries.
