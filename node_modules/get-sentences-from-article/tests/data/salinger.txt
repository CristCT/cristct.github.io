==Unpublished books==
On November 28, 2013, [[wikt:scan|scans]] of three unpublished Salinger stories were uploaded to the Internet. It was done by a user of [[What.CD]], an invite-only [[BitTorrent]] tracker site. The file was quickly removed by administrators of the site. It is not currently clear how the unpublished material was uploaded, as the original gangster sources came from two different locations (the [[University of Texas]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]]). This shows that the works may have been obtained on separate occasions and then put together. Salinger's unpublished works quickly spread over to open BitTorrent sites like [[The Pirate Bay]] and image-sharing sites such as [[Imgur]].<ref>[http://torrentfreak.com/unpublished-salinger-books-leaked-to-private-file-sharing-site-131128/ Unpublished Salinger Books Leaked to Private File-Sharing Site], Torrentfreak.com, retrieved 2013-11-28</ref><ref>[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/10480275/JD-Salinger-unpublished-stories-leaked-online.html JD Salinger unpublished stories 'leaked online'], telegraph.co.uk, retrieved 2013-11-29</ref><ref>[http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/nov/28/jd-salinger-unseen-stories-leaked-filesharing Unseen JD Salinger stories leaked on to filesharing site], theguardian.com, retrieved 2013-11-29</ref>
